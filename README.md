#Quadcopter control station

This project is a personnal project written in Java 8 for controlling my DIY quadcopter. The goal of the project is to control my quadcopter using an XBOX 360 controller and receive telemetry data. The XBOX controller commands are handled by the application, processed and send to the quadcopter using a serial device (APC220, RFD900, ...).
